<p>
  <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/apps/gedit/">gedit</a> 48 has been
  released and is available on the three main desktop operating systems. Let's
  look at the highlights of this new version.
</p>

<h3>Dark theme</h3>

  has already been covered.
</p>

<h3>World/gedit/ subgroup on GNOME's GitLab</h3>
<p>
  The main Git repositories of gedit are now all hosted under the
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit">World/gedit/</a>
  subgroup on GNOME's GitLab. It currently includes gedit, gedit-plugins and all
  the libgedits.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, there was the problem that the libgedits - hosted on GitHub -
  didn't receive new translations. This is now resolved, all the relevant
  modules are on <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/">l10n.gnome.org</a>. Thanks to
  the amazing work done by the GNOME translation teams, gedit is available in
  many languages with high quality translations!
</p>

<h3>Summary of changes for plugins</h3>
<p>
  Concerning the plugins, there is unfortunately a bad news. The following
  plugins have been removed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>External Tools</li>
  <li>Git</li>
  <li>Quick Open</li>
  <li>Snippets</li>
</ul>

<p>
  There are several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The primary reason is to have less code to maintain for the core gedit
    developers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some of these plugins had bugs that made the application to crash. It is
    time consuming to investigate and properly fix such issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    And, it is always possible for other developers to bring a second life to a
    removed plugin, by copying the code into another repository. See the list of
    <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/gedit/-/blob/master/plugins/third-party-plugins.md">third-party plugins</a>
    for some examples.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Text Size plugin has been promoted: it has been moved from the
    gedit-plugins repository to the main gedit repository, and is now enabled by
    default. So you can now zoom in and zoom out the text more easily.
  </li>
  <li>
    As always, there are a plethora of other little changes to improve the code
    quality.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>To conclude</h3>
<p>
  Don't hesitate to get in touch, be it for providing a general feedback, or for
  reporting specific issues, or for contributing.

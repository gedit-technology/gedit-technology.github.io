<h2>2024-11-19 :: What's new in gedit 48</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/apps/gedit/">gedit</a> 48 was
  released in September. Now that the new version is available on the three main
  desktop operating systems, let's look at the highlights.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/blog/2024-06-19-dark-theme-support-in-gedit.html">dark theme support</a>
  has already been covered. If you see some issues, don't hesitate to
  <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/apps/gedit/reporting-bugs.html">open a ticket on GitLab</a>.

<h3>Hosting the libgedit projects on the GNOME infrastructure</h3>
<p>
  In the blog post describing the
  <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/blog/2024-05-24-gedit-47-released-and-packaged.html">release of gedit 47</a>,
  it was explained that translations were temporarily disabled. It has now been
  resolved by hosting all the libgedit projects on the GNOME infrastructure, to
  benefit from <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/">l10n.gnome.org</a> among other
  things.
</p>
<p>
  The git repositories for gedit, gedit-plugins and all the libgedits are now
  hosted in the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit">World/gedit/</a>
  subgroup on GNOME's GitLab!
</p>

<h3>Summary of changes for plugins</h3>
<p>The following plugins have been <em>removed</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>External Tools</li>
  <li>Git</li>
  <li>Quick Open</li>
  <li>Snippets</li>
</ul>

<p>
  On the other hand the Text Size plugin has received a promotion: it has been
  moved from the gedit-plugins repository to the main gedit repository, and is
  now enabled by default.
</p>

<h3>Why some plugins have been removed?</h3>
<p>
  It is a combination of several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Some of the removed plugins had bugs that made the application to crash. Of
    course it would have been possible to fix the crashes, but it requires time
    to investigate the issues and then to find proper solutions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      All removed plugins were implemented in Python, and Python code is more
      difficult to maintain in the long run. There are still eight gedit plugins
      written in Python, but it is hoped that Python usage will be reduced in
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      More on that later in a future blog post.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    To simply have less code to maintain for the core gedit developers.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is always possible for other developers to bring a second life to the
    removed plugins, by copying the code into a third-party repository. See the
    list of
    <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/gedit/-/blob/master/plugins/third-party-plugins.md">third-party plugins</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>2024-06-19 :: Dark theme support in gedit</h2>

<p>
  The development version of
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/">gedit</a> now has a
  much more complete support of light and dark themes, and switching between
  them from the desktop setting.
</p>

<h3>How it looks</h3>
<p>
  With the Solarized Dark color scheme for the main text area, and the Adwaita
  dark GTK theme:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2024-06-19/gedit-screenshot-dark-theme-main-window.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2024-06-19/thumbnail-gedit-screenshot-dark-theme-main-window.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot of the main window with dark theme"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  The Preferences dialog:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2024-06-19/gedit-screenshot-dark-theme-preferences-dialog.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2024-06-19/gedit-screenshot-dark-theme-preferences-dialog.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot of the preferences dialog with dark theme"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2024-06-19/gedit-screenshot-light-theme-preferences-dialog.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2024-06-19/gedit-screenshot-light-theme-preferences-dialog.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot of the preferences dialog with light theme"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Possibilities and limitations</h3>
<p>
  It's possible to follow the system style (the desktop-wide setting that is
  applied to all the applications at once), or to force the light or dark theme
  variant.
</p>
<p>
  For the main text area a <em>color scheme</em> must be applied. There are thus
  <em>two</em> color schemes to choose: for the light versus dark theme
  variants, to automatically switch the color scheme.
</p>
<p>
  The Preferences dialog also allows you to choose a <em>dark</em> color scheme
  when a <em>light</em> theme variant is in effect, or vice-versa. If this was
  not possible, it would have been annoying to some people.
</p>
<p>
  There is however <strong>a minor limitation</strong>: the Classic and Tango
  color schemes are supported only with the light theme variant, because some
  colors are inherited from the theme and the other colors have been defined
  with a <em>light</em> theme in mind (see
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit/-/issues/547">this issue on GitLab</a>
  with a screenshot of the text being unreadable).<br />
  So when the dark theme is applied, it is not possible to select Classic or
  Tango and their descriptions become "Unsupported for the dark theme variant"
  (by the way, it's better to keep them in the list and show an explanation; if
  Classic and Tango suddenly disappear from the list, you would have thought
  that there is a bug somewhere).
</p>
<p>
  It is also
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gedit/-/commit/b655bd6bdf9b9fab1046960591fe823aa5aee16a">documented</a>
  in the user manual, if you're curious.
</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>
  The heavy-lifting is done by
  <a href="https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libhandy/">libhandy</a>,
  and the actual dark theme (the Adwaita one) comes from
  <a href="https://gtk.org/">GTK</a> and its CSS engine.
</p>
<p>
  Some work was left to do in libgedit-gtksourceview for the color/style
  schemes; in libgedit-tepl for the components in the Preferences dialog plus a
  few other things; and finally in gedit to integrate what libgedit-tepl
  provides.
</p>
<p>
  In gedit there are now two GSettings keys for the color schemes, plus another
  key for the theme-variant, as can be seen in this <code>dconf watch</code>
  demo session:
</p>
<pre>
$ dconf watch /
/org/gnome/gedit/preferences/editor/style-scheme-for-dark-theme-variant
  'oblivion'

/org/gnome/gedit/preferences/ui/theme-variant
  'light'

/org/gnome/gedit/preferences/editor/style-scheme-for-light-theme-variant
  'classic'
</pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  This feature was asked by many people and it's finally there. It will be
  available in gedit 48, the next stable version to be released soon if
  everything goes well.
</p>
<p>
  Do not hesitate to
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/">get in touch</a>
  and provide a feedback, be it for this feature or for other things.

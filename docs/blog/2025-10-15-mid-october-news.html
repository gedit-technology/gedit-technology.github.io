  Misc news about the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">gedit text editor</a>,
  mid-October edition! (Some sections are a bit technical).
</p>

<h3>Rework of the file loading and saving (continued)</h3>
<p>
  The refactoring continues in the libgedit-gtksourceview module, this time to
  tackle a big class that takes too much responsibilities. A utility is in
  development which will permit to delegate a part of the work.
</p>
<p>
  The utility is about character encoding conversion, with support of invalid
  bytes. It takes as input a single GBytes (the file content), and transforms it
  into a list of chunks. A chunk contains either valid (successfully converted)
  bytes, or invalid bytes. The output format - the "list of chunks" - is subject
  to change to improve memory consumption and performances.
</p>
<p>
  Note that invalid bytes are allowed, to be able to open really any kind of
  files with gedit.
</p>
<p>
  I must also note that this is quite sensitive work, at the heart of document
  loading for gedit. Normally all these refactorings and improvements will be
  worth it!
</p>

<h3>Progress in other modules</h3>
<p>
  There has been some progress on other modules:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>gedit:</strong> version 48.1.1 has been released with a few minor
    updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Flatpak</strong> on Flathub: update to gedit 48.1.1 and the
    GNOME 49 runtime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>gspell:</strong> version 1.14.1 has been released, mainly to pick up
    the updated translations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>GitHub Sponsors</h3>

  GitHub Sponsors. See the

<h2>2026-01-16 :: gedit 49.0 released</h2>

<p>
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">gedit</a> 49.0 has
  been released! Here are the highlights since version 48.0 which dates back
  from September 2024. (Some sections are a bit technical).
</p>

<h3>File loading and saving enhancements</h3>
<p>
  A lot of work went into this area. It's mostly under-the-scene changes where
  there was a lot of dusty code. It's not entirely finished, but there are
  already user-visible enhancements:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Loading a big file is now much faster.</li>
  <li>
    gedit now refuses to load very big files, with a configurable limit
    (<a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/blog/2025-12-17-mid-december-news.html" target="_blank">more details</a>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improved preferences</h3>
<p>
  <a href="images/2025-07-14/prefs-reset.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2025-07-14/prefs-reset.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot - reset all preferences"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2025-07-14/prefs-spell-checker.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2025-07-14/prefs-spell-checker.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot - spell-checker preferences"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  There is now a "Reset All..." button in the Preferences dialog. And it is now
  possible to configure the default language used by the spell-checker.
</p>

<h3>Python plugins removal</h3>
<p>
  Initially due to an external factor, plugins implemented in Python were no
  longer supported.
</p>
<p>
  During some time a previous version of gedit was packaged in Flathub in a way
  that still enabled Python plugins, but it is no longer the case.
</p>
<p>
  Even though the problem is fixable, having some plugins in Python meant to
  deal with a multi-language project, which is much harder to maintain for a
  single individual. So for now it's preferable to keep only the C language.
</p>
<p>
  So the bad news is that Python plugins support has not been re-enabled in this
  version, not even for third-party plugins.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/blog/2025-04-30-no-more-pythons-in-gedit.html" target="_blank">More details</a>.
</p>

<h3>Summary of changes for plugins</h3>
<p>
  The following plugins have been removed:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bracket Completion</li>
  <li>Character Map</li>
  <li>Color Picker</li>
  <li>Embedded Terminal</li>
  <li>Join/Split Lines</li>
  <li>Multi Edit</li>
  <li>Session Saver</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Only Python plugins have been removed, the C plugins have been kept.
  The Code Comment plugin which was written in Python has been rewritten in C,
  so it has not disappeared. And it is planned and desired to bring back some of
  the removed plugins.
</p>

<h3>Summary of other news</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Lots of code refactorings have been achieved in the gedit core and in
    libgedit-gtksourceview.
  </li>
  <li>
    A better support for Windows.
  </li>
  <li>
    Web presence at gedit-text-editor.org: new domain name and several
    iterations on the design.
  </li>
  <li>
    A half-dozen
    <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/gedit/-/tree/master/docs/guidelines" target="_blank">Gedit Development Guidelines</a>
    documents have been written.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Wrapping-up statistics for 2025</h3>
<p>
  The total number of commits in gedit and gedit-related git repositories in
  2025 is: 884. More precisely:
</p>
<pre>
138	enter-tex
310	gedit
21	gedit-plugins
10	gspell
4	libgedit-amtk
41	libgedit-gfls
290	libgedit-gtksourceview
70	libgedit-tepl
</pre>
<p>
  It counts all contributions, translation updates included.
</p>
<p>
  The list contains two apps, gedit and
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/enter-tex" target="_blank">Enter TeX</a>.
  The rest are shared libraries (re-usable code available to create other text
  editors).
</p>
<p>
  If you do a comparison with
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/blog/2025-01-07-various-news.html" target="_blank">the numbers for 2024</a>,
  you'll see that there are fewer commits, the only module with <em>more</em>
  commits is libgedit-gtksourceview. But 2025 was a good year nevertheless!
</p>

<h3>For future versions: superset of the subset</h3>
<p>
  With Python plugins removed, the new gedit version is a subset of the previous
  version, when comparing approximately the list of features. In the future, we
  plan to have a <em>superset of the subset</em>. That is, to bring in new
  features and try hard to <em>not</em> remove any more functionality.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, we have reached a point where we are no longer interested to remove
  any more features from gedit. So the good news is that gedit will normally be
  incrementally improved from now on without major regressions. We really hope
  there won't be any new bad surprises due to external factors!
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Side note:</strong> this "superset of the subset" resembles the
  evolution of C++, but in the reverse order. Modern C++ will be a
  <a href="https://thenewstack.io/bjarne-stroustrups-plan-for-bringing-safety-to-c/" target="_blank">subset of the superset</a>
  to have a language
  <a href="https://herbsutter.com/2024/03/11/safety-in-context/" target="_blank">in practice (but not in theory)
  as safe as Rust</a>
  (it works with compiler flags to disable the unsafe parts).
</p>

<h3>Onward to 2026</h3>
<p>
  Since some plugins have been removed, this makes gedit a less advanced text
  editor. It has become a little less suitable for heavy programming workloads,
  but for that there are lots of alternatives.
</p>
<p>
  Instead, gedit could become a text editor of choice for newcomers in the
  computing science field (students and self-learners). It can be a great tool
  for markup languages too. It can be your daily companion for quite a while,
  until your needs evolve for something more complete at your workplace. Or it
  can be that you prefer its simplicity and its not-going-in-the-way default
  setup, plus the fact that it launches quickly. In short, there are a lot of
  reasons to still love gedit ❤️ !
</p>
<p>
  If you have any feedback, even for a small thing, I would like to hear from
  you :) ! The best places are on GNOME Discourse, or GitLab for more actionable
  tasks (see the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">Getting in Touch</a>
  section).

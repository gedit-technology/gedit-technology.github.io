<p>
  <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/apps/gedit/">gedit</a> 47 has been
  released and packaged recently.
</p>

<h3>What's new</h3>
<p>
  The <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/blog/2024-04-26-change-of-icons-and-logo-for-gedit.html">change of icons and logo</a>
  was already explained.
</p>

<h4>Dark GTK theme support - some progress</h4>
<p>
  There is some progress to better support the dark GTK theme variant. On Linux
  you can use the <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/DconfEditor/">Dconf Editor</a>
  application or the <code>gsettings</code> command in a terminal to change
  gedit to use the dark theme:
</p>
<pre>
$ gsettings get org.gnome.gedit.preferences.ui theme-variant
'light'
$ gsettings set org.gnome.gedit.preferences.ui theme-variant "'dark'"

# To reset to the default value:
$ gsettings reset org.gnome.gedit.preferences.ui theme-variant
</pre>
<p>
  Some more work is necessary to finish this feature. It is planned to add a
  'system' setting, to follow the desktop config. To adapt the Preferences
  dialog. And to avoid showing bugs with color schemes that don't support dark
  GTK themes (classic and tango), or to fix those color schemes (but since they
  inherit colors from the GTK theme, it is currently expected that these colors
  come from a <em>light</em> theme).
</p>

<h4>For plugin developers: improved API documentation</h4>
<p>
  The main classes of gedit are now much better
  <a href="https://gedit-technology.github.io/developer-docs/gedit/">documented</a>.
</p>

<h4>Translations temporarily disabled</h4>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the translations (or localization, l10n) is temporarily
  disabled. So gedit is available in English only. (You can still write
  documents in any language thanks to the Unicode support, of course).
</p>
<p>
  This is because the Gedit Technology modules that are hosted on GitHub need
  something else than <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/">l10n.gnome.org</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Work is being done to address this issue. One translation platform has already
  been tested but was not really satisfactory, so another platform is currently
  being tested at the time of writing this.
</p>

<h4>Refactoring and making more code re-usable, as always</h4>
<p>
  Code refactoring is necessary for gedit. Cleaner code permits to better see
  bugs, to fix them and (hopefully) prevent them from re-appearing in the
  future.
</p>

<h3>Packaging work</h3>
<p>
  gedit is
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NCQ8B0NVCW3">available on the Microsoft Store</a>.
  It is a way to finance the project, so every purchase helps.
</p>
<p>
  For Linux, the latest gedit is
  <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.gedit">available on Flathub</a>.
  It finally has the Verified badge, and the Flatpak is now directly updated by
  the upstream developers.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Contrarily to what is sometimes expected from a software release, this is
  unfortunately not the best gedit release ever because of the transition for
  the translation platform. gedit 48 will be a better version in that regard.
</p>
<p>
  We wanted to release a new version instead of waiting more, because we prefer
  more iterations instead of bigger releases. For a project like gedit, it's
  sometimes a bit a rocky road to drive the project further. On the brighter
  side, gedit should be more robust overall (the code has seen some bug fixes
  and many small code improvements under the hood).

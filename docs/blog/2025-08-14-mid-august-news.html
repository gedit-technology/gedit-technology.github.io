<h2>2025-08-14 :: Mid-August News</h2>

<p>
  Misc news about the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">gedit</a>
  text editor, mid-August edition! (Some sections are a bit technical).
</p>

<h3>Code Comment plugin rewritten</h3>
<p>
  I forgot to talk about it in the mid-July news, but the Code Comment plugin
  has been rewritten in C (it was previously implemented in Python) and the bulk
  of it is implemented as re-usable code in libgedit-tepl. The implementation is
  now shared between
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/enter-tex" target="_blank">Enter TeX</a>
  and gedit.
</p>

<h3>File loading and saving: a new GtkSourceEncoding class</h3>
<p>
  I've modified the GtkSourceEncoding class that is part of
  libgedit-gtksourceview, and adapted gedit accordingly.
  The new version of GtkSourceEncoding comes from an experiment that I did in
  libgedit-tepl several years ago.
</p>
<p>
  GtkSourceEncoding represents a character set (or "charset" for short). It is
  used in combination with <code>iconv</code> to convert text files from one
  encoding to another (for example from ISO-8859-15 to UTF-8).
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of the experiment that was done in libgedit-tepl (the TeplEncoding
  class) was to accomodate the needs for a
  <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/" target="_blank">uchardet</a>
  usage (note that uchardet is not yet used by gedit, but it would be useful).
  uchardet is a library to automatically detect the encoding of some input text.
  It returns an iconv-compatible charset, as a string.
</p>
<p>
  It is <em>this string</em> - returned by uchardet - that we want to store and
  pass to <code>iconv</code> unmodified, to not lose information.
</p>
<p>
  The problem with the old version of GtkSourceEncoding: there was a fixed set
  of GtkSourceEncoding instances, all <code>const</code> (so without the need to
  free them). When trying to get an instance for an unknown charset string, NULL
  was returned. So this was not appropriate for a uchardet usage (or at least,
  not a clean solution: with the charset string returned by uchardet it was not
  guaranteed that a corresponding GtkSourceEncoding instance was available).
</p>
<p>
  Since GtkSourceEncoding is used in a lot of places, we don't want to change
  the code to represent a charset as just a string. And a simple string is
  anyway too basic, GtkSourceEncoding provides useful features.
</p>
<p>
  So, long story short: the new GtkSourceEncoding class returns new instances
  that must be freed, and has a constructor that just makes a copy of the
  charset string (there is the <code>get_charset()</code> method to get back the
  string, unmodified).
</p>
<p>
  So gedit can keep using the GtkSourceEncoding abstraction, and we are one step
  closer to being able to use uchardet or something similar!
</p>

<h3>Know more about the gedit's maintainer</h3>
<p>
  I now have a personal web site, or more accurately a single web
  <em>page</em>:<br />
  <a href="https://wilmet-software.be/" target="_blank">wilmet-software.be</a>
  (Sébastien Wilmet)
</p>
<p>
  gedit is a 27-years-old project, the first lines were written in 1998
  (and <em>normally</em> it won't be part of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club" target="_blank">27 Club</a>!).
  I've been a contributor to the project for 14 years, so more than half the
  project existence. Time flies!
</p>

<h3>Robust file loading - some progress</h3>
<p>
  After the rework of GtkSourceEncoding (which is part of the File Loading and
  Saving subsystem in libgedit-gtksourceview), I've made good progress to make
  the file loading more robust - although there is more work still to do.
</p>
<p>
  It is a basis in programming to check all program input. gedit makes things a
  bit harder to accomplish this. To open a <em>document</em>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There is first the problem of the character encoding. It is
    not sufficient for a general-purpose text editor to accept only UTF-8. So
    text files can be almost anything in binary form.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then gedit allows to open documents containing
    invalid characters in the specified or auto-detected
    encoding. With this, documents can <em>really</em> be anything in binary
    form.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally the GtkTextView widget used at the heart of gedit has several
    limitations: (1) very big files (like log files or database dumps) are not
    supported, a limit on the content size must be set (and if reached, still
    allow to load the file with truncated content). (2) very long lines cause
    performance problems and can freeze the application.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  So, the good news is that progress has been made on this. (There is only a
  good news, let's stay positive!).
</p>

  If you appreciate the work that I do in gedit, I would like to know your
  feedback, what I should improve or which important feature is missing. You can
  contact me
  <a href="https://wilmet-software.be/" target="_blank">by email</a>
  for example, or on a
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">discussion channel</a>.
  Thank you :-) !

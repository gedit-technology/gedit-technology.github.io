<h2>2025-11-14 :: Mid-November News</h2>

<p>
  Misc news about the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">gedit text editor</a>,
  mid-November edition!
  <!-- (Some sections are a bit technical). -->
</p>

<h3>Website: new design</h3>
<p>
  Probably the highlight this month is the new design of the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">gedit website</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If it looks familiar to some of you, it's normal, it's because it's an
  adaptation of the previous GtkSourceView website that was developed in the old
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/gnomeweb-wml" target="_blank">gnomeweb-wml</a>
  repository. gnomeweb-wml (projects.gnome.org) is what predates all the wiki
  pages for
  <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps" target="_blank">Apps</a>
  and
  <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects" target="_blank">Projects</a>.
  The wiki has been retired, so another solution had to be found.
</p>
<p>
  For the timeline, projects.gnome.org was available until 2013/2014 where all
  the content had been migrated to the wiki. Then the wiki has been retired in
  2024.
</p>
<p>
  Note that there are still rough edges on the gedit website, and more
  importantly some efforts still need to be done to bring the old CSS stylesheet
  forward to the new(-ish) responsive web design world.
</p>

      <a href="images/2025-11-14/screenshot-gedit-website-in-october-2025.png"

                              alt="Screenshot of gedit website in October 2025" /></a>
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  What we can say is that the gedit project has stood the test of time!
</p>

<h3>Enter TeX: improved search and replace</h3>
<p>
  Some context: I would like some day to unify the search and replace feature
  between Enter TeX and gedit. It needs to retain the best of each.
</p>
<p>
  In Enter TeX it's a combined horizontal bar, something that I would like in
  gedit too to replace the dialog window that occludes part of the text.
</p>
<p>
  In gedit the strengths include: the search-as-you-type possibility, and a
  history of past searches. Both are missing in Enter TeX. (These are not the
  only things that need to be retained; the same workflows, keyboard shortcuts
  etc. are also an integral part of the functionality).
</p>
<p>
  So to work towards that goal, I started in Enter TeX. I merged around 50
  commits in the git repository for this change already, rewriting in C (from
  Vala) some parts and improving the UI along the way. The code needs to be in C
  because it'll be moved to libgedit-tepl so that it can be consumed by gedit
  easily.
</p>
<p>
  Here is how it looks:

                          width="250"
                          alt="Screenshot of the search and replace in Enter TeX" /></a>
</p>

<h3>Internal refactoring for GeditWindow and its statusbar</h3>
<p>
  GeditWindow is what we can call a god class. It is too big, both in the number
  of lines and the number of instance variables.
</p>
<p>
  So this month I've continued to refactor it, to extract a GeditWindowStatus
  class. There was already a GeditStatusbar class, but its features have now
  been moved to libgedit-tepl as TeplStatusbar.
</p>
<p>
  GeditWindowStatus takes up the responsibility to create the TeplStatusbar, to
  fill it with the indicators and other buttons, and to make the connection with
  GeditWindow and the current tab/document.
</p>
<p>
  So as a result, GeditWindow is a little less omniscient ;-)
</p>

<h3>As a conclusion</h3>
<p>
  gedit does not materialize out of empty space; it takes time to develop and
  maintain. To demonstrate your appreciation of this piece of software and help
  its future development, remember that you can
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/donations.html" target="_blank">fund the project</a>.
  Your support is critical and much appreciated.

<h2>2025-02-11 :: Enter TeX</h2>

<p>
  As promised, I wanted to write a blog post about this application.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/swilmet/enter-tex/">Enter TeX</a> is a
  <a href="https://tug.org/">TeX</a> /
  <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>
  text editor previously named LaTeXila and then GNOME LaTeX. It is based on the
  same libraries as <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/">gedit</a>.
</p>

<h3>Renames</h3>
<p>
  LaTeXila was a fun name that I picked up when I was a student back in 2009.
  Then the project was renamed to GNOME LaTeX in 2017 but it was not a great
  choice because of the GNOME trademark. Now it is called <em>Enter TeX</em>.
</p>
<p>
  By having "TeX" in the name is more future-proof than "LaTeX", because there
  is also Plain TeX, <a href="https://wiki.contextgarden.net/">ConTeXt</a> and
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/">GNU Texinfo</a>. Only LaTeX is
  currently well supported by Enter TeX, but the support for other variants
  would be a welcome addition.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the settings and configuration files are automatically migrated from
  LaTeXila or GNOME LaTeX to Enter TeX.
</p>
<p>
  There is another rename: the namespace for the C code has been changed from
  "Latexila" to "Gtex", to have a shorter and better name.
</p>

<h3>Other news</h3>
<p>
  If you're curious, you can read the top of the
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/swilmet/enter-tex/-/blob/main/NEWS">NEWS file</a>,
  it has all the details.
</p>
<p>
  If I look at the
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/swilmet/enter-tex/-/blob/main/docs/achievements.md">achievements file</a>,
  there is also the port from Autotools to Meson that was done recently and is
  worth mentioning.
</p>

<h3>Known issue for the icons</h3>
<p>
  Enter TeX unfortunately suffers from a combination of changes in
  adwaita-icon-theme and GThemedIcon (part of GIO). Link to the
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/3376">issue on GitLab</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Compare the two screenshots and choose the one you prefer:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2025-02-11/screenshot1.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/2025-02-11/screenshot1.png" alt="screenshot 1" width="300" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2025-02-11/screenshot2.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/2025-02-11/screenshot2.png" alt="screenshot 2" width="300" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  As an interim solution, what I do is to install adwaita-icon-theme 41.0 in the
  same prefix as where Enter TeX is installed (not a system-wide prefix).
</p>

<h3>To summarize</h3>
<ul>
  <li>LaTeXila -> GNOME LaTeX -> Enter TeX</li>
  <li>C code namespace: Latexila -> Gtex</li>
  <li>Build system: Autotools -> Meson</li>
  <li>An old version of adwaita-icon-theme is necessary.</li>
</ul>

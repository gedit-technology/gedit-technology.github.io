<h2>2025-01-07 :: Various news about gedit</h2>

<p>
  A new year begins, a good time to share some various news about
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/">gedit</a>.
</p>

<h3>gedit-text-editor.org</h3>
<p>
  gedit has a new domain name for its website:
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/">gedit-text-editor.org</a>
</p>
<p>
  Previously, the gedit homepage was
  <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit">on the GNOME wiki</a>,
  but the wiki has been retired. So a new website has been set up.
</p>
<p>
  Some work on the website is still necessary, especially to better support
  mobile devices (responsive web design), and also for printing the pages. If
  you are a seasoned web developer and want to contribute, don't hesitate to get
  in touch!
</p>

<h3>Wrapping-up statistics for 2024</h3>
<p>
  The total number of commits in gedit and gedit-related git repositories in
  2024 is: 1042. More precisely:
</p>
<pre>
300	enter-tex
365	gedit
52	gedit-plugins
50	gspell
13	libgedit-amtk
54	libgedit-gfls
47	libgedit-gtksourceview
161	libgedit-tepl
</pre>
<p>
  It counts all contributions, translation updates included.
</p>
<p>
  The list contains two apps, gedit and
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/swilmet/enter-tex">Enter TeX</a>.
  The rest are shared libraries (re-usable code available to create other text
  editors).
</p>
<p>
  Enter TeX is a TeX/LaTeX editor previously named LaTeXila and GNOME LaTeX.
  It depends on
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/technology.html">Gedit Technology</a>
  and drives some of its development. So it makes sense to include it alongside
  gedit. A blog post about Enter TeX will most probably be written, to shed some
  light on this project that started in 2009.
</p>

<h3>Onwards to 2025</h3>
<p>
  The development continues! To get the latest news, you can follow this blog
  or, alternatively, you can

<h2>2025-07-14 :: Mid-July News</h2>

<p>
  Misc news about the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/">gedit</a>
  text editor, mid-July edition! (Some sections are a bit technical).
</p>

<h3>gedit 49 in preparation</h3>
<p>
  About version numbers: if all goes well, gedit 49 will match GNOME 49 and are
  expected for September! So gedit will be back on track to follow the GNOME
  version numbers. This is after some trials to <em>not</em> follow them, to
  release gedit versions when ready and more often, but at the end of the day
  this doesn't change much.
</p>

<h3>Gedit Development Guidelines</h3>
<p>
  I've written the
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/gedit/-/tree/master/docs/guidelines">Gedit Development Guidelines</a>,
  a series of small Markdown documents. It regroups the information in one
  place. It also documents stuff that needed to be written in commit messages,
  so to avoid repetition and to have more complete explanations, commit messages
  can now refer to the guideline documents.
</p>
<p>
  Be warned that some of the gedit guidelines don't follow the more modern GNOME
  development practices. The rationales are clearly explained. In my humble
  opinion, what is deemed "modern" doesn't automatically make something better.
  (If you read this and <em>are</em> a developer of one of the modern things not
  used by gedit, take it as a user feedback, and remember that what truly
  matters is that the GTK development platform is still appreciated!).
</p>

<h3>Improved preferences</h3>
<p>
  <a href="images/2025-07-14/prefs-reset.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2025-07-14/prefs-reset.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot - reset all preferences"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="images/2025-07-14/prefs-spell-checker.png" target="_blank"><img
    src="images/2025-07-14/prefs-spell-checker.png"
    alt="gedit screenshot - spell-checker preferences"
    width="250" /></a>
</p>
<p>
  There is now a "Reset All..." button in the Preferences dialog. And it is now
  possible to configure the default language used by the spell-checker.
</p>

<h3>Python plugins</h3>
<p>
  Most Linux distributions ship some older versions of some GNOME modules to
  make Python plugins in gedit (and other apps) still work. There has been some
  disturbances in the air, but my hope is that everything will be back to normal
  for GNOME 49.
</p>

<h3>File loading and saving</h3>
<p>
  There are some known issues with the file loading implementation, and I'm
  working on it.
</p>
<p>
  About the old <code>iconv()</code> function, I've created a utility class called
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/libgedit-gtksourceview/-/blob/main/gtksourceview/file-loading-and-saving/gtksourceiconv.c" target="_blank">GtkSourceIconv</a>
  to (try to) tame the beast, except that the beast <em>cannot be fully
  tamed</em>, by design! Some aspects of its API are broken, and what I
  recommend for new code is to look at the libICU to see if it's better.
  (gtksourceiconv.c has a comment at the top with more details).
</p>
<p>
  But instead of doing ground-breaking changes in the file loading and saving
  code (to switch to the libICU), I prefer a more incremental approach, and this
  means to still use <code>iconv()</code> (for the time being at least). The
  advantage is that incremental changes are directly useful and used; progress
  is made on gedit!
</p>
<p>
  I attempted a while back a new implementation in libgedit-tepl (TeplEncoding,
  TeplFile, etc). The problem is that I created a different API, so switching
  the whole of gedit to it was more difficult. And the new implementation lacked
  several important features used by gedit.
</p>
<p>
  Now I'm moving some of my experiments done in libgedit-tepl back to
  libgedit-gtksourceview, because it's the latter (GtkSourceEncoding,
  GtkSourceFile, etc) that is used by gedit's file loading and saving machinery.
  libgedit-gtksourceview doesn't guarantee a stable API, and I consider it part
  of gedit, so it's more <em>malleable code</em> :-)

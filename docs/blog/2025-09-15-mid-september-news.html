  Misc news about the
  <a href="https://gedit-text-editor.org/" target="_blank">gedit</a>
  text editor, mid-September edition! (Some sections are a bit technical).
</p>

<h3>Next version will be released when Ready</h3>
<p>
  While the release of GNOME 49.0 was approaching (it's this week!), I came to
  the conclusion that it's best for gedit to wait more, and to follow the Debian
  way of releasing software: when it's Ready. "Ready" with an uppercase letter
  'R'!
</p>
<p>
  So the question is: what is <em>not</em> ready? Two main things:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The rework of the file loading and saving: it is something that takes time,
    and I prefer to be sure that it'll be a solid solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    The question about the Python support for implementing plugins. Time will
    tell what is the answer.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Rework of the file loading and saving (next steps)</h3>
<p>
  Work continues to refactor that part of the code, both in
  libgedit-gtksourceview and gedit.
</p>
<p>
  I won't go into too much technical details this time. But what the previous
  developer (Ignacio Casal Quinteiro, aka nacho)
  <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/gedit/gedit/-/commit/89fe90084cfa3c727589fafa969a9678208a8652" target="_blank">wrote</a>
  (in 2011) in a comment at the top of a class is
  <em>"welcome to a really big headache."</em>
</p>
<p>
  And naturally, I want to improve the situation. For a long time this class was
  used as a black box, using only its interface. Time has come to change things!
  It takes time, but I already see the end of the tunnel and I have good hopes
  that the code will be better structured. I intend to write about it more once
  finished.
</p>
<p>
  But I can reveal that there is already a visible improvement: loading a big
  file (e.g. 200 MB) is now super fast! Previously, it could take one minute to
  load such file, with a progress bar shown and a Cancel button. Now there is
  not enough time to even click on (or to see) the Cancel button! (I'm talking
  about local files, for remote files with a slow network connection, the
  progress bar is still useful).
</p>
<p>
  To be continued...

<p>
    libgedit-tepl is a library that eases the development of text editors and
    IDEs based on GTK. Tepl is the acronym for “Text editor product line”.
  </p>
<p>
    The libgedit-tepl library follows a product line approach, inspired by
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Feature-Oriented Software Product Lines: Concepts and
    Implementation</em></span> (2013 - Apel, Batory, Kästner and Saake).
  </p>
<p>
    Instead of creating one general-purpose text editor or IDE with a plugin
    system, the idea is to create several <span class="emphasis"><em>specialized</em></span> text
    editors. For example specialized for one programming language, or one
    development platform, or a small group of related languages. By being
    specialized, an application is potentially better at what it does. It
    follows more closely the UNIX philosophy to “do only one thing but do it
    well”. And it better follows the GNOME philosophy: writing applications that
    Just Works; when a user opens the text editor for the first time, it should
    work out-of-the-box, without the need to find, install and configure
    plugins. Of course it still makes sense to develop one general-purpose text
    editor for the languages not yet covered by specialized text editors.
  </p>
<p>
    Most of the features of the library are available as a toolkit, but the
    interesting part of libgedit-tepl is that it contains also a framework (for
    now without a plugin system). The goal of the framework is to provide
    higher-level APIs, to be able to create a new text editor easily. An
    application wanting to use libgedit-tepl is not forced to use the framework
    in its entirety, it is possible to use just the toolkit parts. The library
    is implemented this way to achieve maximum re-usability: the framework is
    less re-usable because it makes some assumptions about the general
    architecture of the application, but since the features are also available
    with a lower-level API – as a toolkit – all text editors and IDEs
    based on GTK and libgedit-gtksourceview (or even other types of
    applications) should be able to benefit from the features implemented in
    libgedit-tepl.
  </p>
<p>
    Initially, libgedit-tepl was created as an incubator for new GtkSourceView
    features, but in practice the features remained in libgedit-tepl, because
    libgedit-tepl is considered less stable for its APIs, and it's convenient to
    iterate on the APIs with more freedom. Another reason is that renaming the
    namespace of all symbols is difficult to do in C.
  </p>
<div class="refsect1">
<a name="id-1.2.7"></a><h2>Boundary between libgedit-gtksourceview and libgedit-tepl</h2>
<p>
      For the framework part of libgedit-tepl (not the toolkit parts), there is
      a somewhat clear boundary between libgedit-gtksourceview and
      libgedit-tepl: the top-level object in libgedit-gtksourceview is the
      <a href="../libgedit-gtksourceview-300/GtkSourceView.html#GtkSourceView-struct">GtkSourceView</a> widget (representing
      only one view, or one file), while the GtkSourceView widget is at the
      bottom of the containment hierarchy in the libgedit-tepl framework (it is
      a “somewhat” clear boundary because there is also
      <a class="link" href="TeplBuffer.html" title="TeplBuffer">TeplBuffer</a>, a subclass of
      <a href="../libgedit-gtksourceview-300/GtkSourceBuffer.html#GtkSourceBuffer-struct">GtkSourceBuffer</a>).
    </p>
<p>
      The top-level object in libgedit-tepl is
      <a class="link" href="TeplApplication.html" title="TeplApplication">TeplApplication</a>, representing the
      whole application which can contain several windows, with each window
      containing one or several GtkSourceView widgets (typically with a Tabbed
      Document Interface).
    </p>
<p>
      So the libgedit-gtksourceview library is not aware that there can be
      several files opened in the application, while the libgedit-tepl framework
      has a complete view of the application with regards to the opened
      files/tabs. It permits to implement higher-level APIs.
    </p>

<div class="refsect1">
<a name="id-1.2.8"></a><h2>API stability</h2>
<p>
      The API is now constantly <span class="emphasis"><em>unstable</em></span>. The library
      soname is adapted (if needed) for each release.
    </p>
<p>
      libgedit-tepl contains experimental APIs, sometimes even unfinished
      features. API design is hard, it needs an iterative process. Instead of
      being stuck for years with a non-optimal API, the libgedit-tepl developers
      want to be able to break the API at any time, to iteratively improve it.
      Sometimes we see possible improvements several years later.
    </p>
<p>
      The API breaks are documented in
      <a class="link" href="api-breaks.html" title="Part IV. API Breaks">this section</a>.
